# Optimizing-Buying-Strategies-for-Diamonds

### Project Objectives

- To provide insights and recommendations for efficient and cost-effective diamond buying strategies.

- To determine the key factors influencing diamond prices.
  
- To find the point of diminishing returns in terms of an increase in quality vs the increase in
price.

### Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 9 predictor variables with 50,000+ records. The first 6 are quantitative, while the remaining 3 are categorical as show below.

1. Carat which is the weight of the diamond. For example, 1 carat is equivalent to .2 grams.
   
2. Depth the height of a diamond measured from the culet to the table divided by its average
girdle diameter

3. Table is the width of the top of the diamond divided by its average girdle diameter.
   
4. X is the length in MM
   
5. Y is the width in MM
   
6. Z is the depth in MM
   
7. The cut which is broken down into 5 different groups from least desirable to most desirable
(Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal). The cut describes the general shape symmetry
proportion and polish of the diamond.

8. Color which has to do with how much yellowing the diamond has. Going from worst to
best is labeled (J, I, H, G, F, E, D).

9. Clarity is how many internal inclusions and external blemishes there are on the diamond.
The scale going from worst to best is as follows (I2, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF)

### Methodology

- Data preprocessing steps (cleaning, transformations).

- Assessment of model assumptions

- Correlation analysis

- Variable selection

- Outlier identification
  
- Model Evaluation (R-squared,Adjusted R-Squared RMSE).

### Key Findings and Conclusion

- Carat, Cut, Color and Calarity were found to be the most significant variables in predicting diamond prices.

- While larger diamonds are more expensive, the analysis suggests a balance between carat size and other quality factors (color, cut, clarity) can yield better value. Opting for a slightly smaller diamond with higher color and clarity grades can be more cost-effective.
